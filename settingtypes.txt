terraform_radius_limit   (the maximum radius of the terraform command)  int 10
# 20 is default, which ranges the threshold between 0.4 and 0.6 for 0-100 in the command. 0 disables it, 100 ranges it between 0 and 1
terraform_threshold_multiplier (Multiplier for the threshold) int 20
# lower makes it more center targeted, high makes it more equally distributed
terraform_gauss_sigma (the sigma value for the gaussian kernel) int 4
# Higher values make it more accurate, but the computation time increase cubic along with the terraform radius
terraform_guass_radius (the radius for the gaussian kernel) int 2
